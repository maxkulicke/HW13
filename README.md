MVC App

This app is designed to allow a user to keep a list of burgers they've eaten in a database, edit them, and delete them.

Using handlebars and mySQL.

My deployed version is having an access issue with the database i have been unable to resolve at the time of submission. The locally stored version works well.

Was unable to do any styling of the app, focused mostly on functionality.

Used the cats MVC app as template.
